# ONLINE-SCHEDULER-FOR-EXTRA-CLASS-DBMS_PROJ
This project lets us schedule extra classes without hassle 
The aim of the project is to build a Database Management System that allows
teachers to book slots for extra online classes. The extra class can be scheduled for a slot
within the next seven days based on the availability of the batch and the professor.
Students can use the product to view their timetable of extra classes for the coming
week. They are also able to retrieve the links to the classes.
Professors can make the booking for an extra class by entering the day, slot and
batch. If the slot is available, the professor can book and once the class is done, the slot is
made accessible. The professor also has the ability to deschedule a class that had been
scheduled if needed.
